PLEASE NOTE:
I believe this WILL work on an original Pi or the Pi Zero, but it will need some tweaking. 
The install process is ridiculously slow on these devices and I'm not going to spend any more
time trying to figure it out.  You will need to use Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Rasbian) due to
the Arm Cortex v6 Processor as opposed to the v7 in the later Pi's.  Please comment on the video
